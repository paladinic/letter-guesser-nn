<img width="444" alt="image" src="https://github.com/linea-analytics/letter-guesser-nn/assets/25911312/4ea4f279-bfa6-4511-9313-f6680839ce35">

## Overview

The Letter Guesser Web App is an open-source static web application that uses a TensorFlow.js model to predict letters drawn by users on a canvas. It's designed to be simple, user-friendly, and accessible to anyone interested in machine learning and web development.

## Features
- Drawing Canvas: Users can draw letters on a responsive canvas.
- Prediction: The TensorFlow.js model predicts the letter based on the drawing.
- Mobile-Friendly: Works on both desktop and mobile devices thanks to touch event handling.
- Easy to Reset: With a clear button, users can quickly erase their drawing and start over.


## How It Works
The web app utilizes a pre-trained TensorFlow.js neural network model to recognize hand-drawn letters. When a user draws a letter on the canvas and presses the "Predict" button, the app processes the image data, feeds it to the neural network, and displays the predicted letter.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Web browser with JavaScript support.
- Internet connection (for the first-time model download).
### Local Setup
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the index.html file in a web browser to start using the app.
```
git clone https://github.com/linea-analytics/letter-guesser-nn.git
```

## Usage
- Use the mouse (or touch on mobile devices) to draw a letter on the canvas.
- Click the "Predict" button to see the app's guess.
- Use the "Clear Canvas" button to erase your drawing.
